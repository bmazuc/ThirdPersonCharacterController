# ThirdPersonCharacterController

A little personal project to brush up on Unity. A character controller using the built-in version. It also allowed me to work with the new input system and cinemachine.
The character can move by turning towards the movement according to the camera, jump, fall and swim. The project works with keyboard and mouse, as well as gamepad. The gamepad was tested with an xbox one controller.
I did what I could with mixamo animations.
